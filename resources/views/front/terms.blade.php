                                The terms are governed by the laws of Cyprus. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms will be litigated
                                exclusively in the courts within Cyprus and we and you consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
                                <br>

                                These terms control the relationship between us and you. They do not create any third-party beneficiary rights.

                                If you do not comply with these terms, and we don't take action right away, this doesn't mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).

                                <br>
                                If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, the term will be modified such that it is enforceable and this will not affect any other terms contained herein.
